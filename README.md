# Transactional Service Management Email Templates

Transactional email templates are an essential component of any service management system. These types of emails are triggered by specific actions taken by a user, such as confirming a purchase or resetting a password. To ensure the effectiveness of these emails, it's important to follow best practices for transactional email templates. This includes using clear and concise language, personalizing the email when possible, and making sure the email is visually appealing and easy to read. Additionally, including relevant information and links can help ensure that users have all the necessary information to complete their desired action.
